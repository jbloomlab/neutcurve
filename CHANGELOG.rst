1.0.0
-----

Added
+++++
- Changes to improve and change way fitting is done. Main conceptual difference is to first fit curves with fixed slope, then re-fit all parameters:
  - Add ``test_curves.ipynb`` example.
  - Add ``init_slope`` to ``HillCurve`` and ``CurveFits``
  - Add ``fix_slope_first`` to ``HillCurve`` and ``CurveFits`` and make it True by default.

- Add calculation of coefficient of determination for fits (R2) to quantify how well curve fits data:
  - Add ``HillCurve.r2`` attribute.
  - Report coefficient of determination as "r2" in ``CurveFits.fitParams`` output.

- Improve exception handling:
  - Add ``HillCurveFittingError``, and when fitting fails raise this exception rather than ``RuntimeError`` as was done previously.
  - Improve error messages for some exceptions and change a few exception types.

- Add ``allow_reps_unequal_conc`` to ``CurveFits`` to all serum/virus replicates with different concentrations

0.10.1
------

Fixed
+++++
- Fixed bug in ``CurveFits.combineCurveFits`` when using only one fit to combine and specifying one of ``sera``, ``viruses``, or ``serum_virus_replicates_to_drop``

0.10.0
------

Added
+++++
- Added the following parameters to ``CurveFits.combineCurveFits``: ``sera``, ``viruses``, ``serum_virus_replicates_to_drop``.

0.9.0
-----

Added
+++++
- Added the ``CurveFits.combineCurveFits`` static method to combine multiple ``CurveFits`` objects.

0.8.0
-----

Added
+++++
- Added ``attempt_shared_legend`` parameter to ``CurveFits.plotReplicates`` to enable plotting many replicates that differ among sera/viruses.

0.7.0
-----

Added
+++++
- Added ``no_average`` option to ``CurveFits.fitParams``.

Fixed
+++++
- Fixed problem in ``fitParams`` when only some concentrations have replicates.

0.6.0
------

Fixed
+++++
- Code format with ``black``
- Lint with ``ruff``
- Test with GitHub Actions rather than Travis
- Move examples in docs to notebooks so they can be tested with ``nbval`` and added to docs with ``nbsphinx``
- Update minimum Python to 3.8 and test on 3.11

Removed
+++++++
- Stop document the "Rachel-style neutralization" and parsing from Excel as these may be deprecated eventually.

0.5.7
------

Added
+++++
- Return standard errors on fit parameters.

0.5.6
------

Fixed
+++++
- Fixed bug with ``orderlegend`` in ``plotGrid``.

0.5.5

Fixed
+++++
- Only import ``dmslogo`` as needed.

0.5.4
-----

Fixed
+++++
- Fixed reading of Excel ``*.xlsx`` files.

0.5.3
-----

Fixed
+++++
- Better fitting of difficult curves by trying multiple optimization methods.

0.5.2
------

Fixed
+++++
- Better error message if virus or serum is `NaN`.

0.5.1
-----

Fixed
++++++
- `CurveFits` now works if `viruses` or `sera` are categorical.

0.4.2
-----

Fixed
++++++
- Bug fix in ylabel plotting.

0.4.1
------

Fixed
+++++
- Better selection of initial fit parameters when `infectivity_or_neutralized` is 'neutralized'.

0.4.0
------

Added
+++++
- `infectivity_or_neutralized` option to allow fitting of fraction neutralized as well as fraction infectivity.

Fixed
+++++
- `scipy` deprecation warnings.

0.3.1
------

Fixed
++++++
- Fixed bug when IC50 is at lower bound.

0.3.0
-----

Added
+++++
- Ability to draw vertical lines on neutralization curves (`vlines` option to `CurveFits.plotGrid` and `CurveFits.plotSera`).

0.2.5
-----

Fixed
+++++

Fixed
++++++++
- Fix bug in `CurveFits.plotGrid` when plotting just wildtype.

0.2.2
---------

Added
+++++++
- `ignore_serum_virus` to `CurveFits.plotSera`.

- Added options to `CurveFits.plotGrid` to **not** share x- and y-axis, and to allow different labels.
